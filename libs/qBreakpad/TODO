Handler:
	- minidump on demand
	- crash-friendly start of reporter external program
	- do we really need 'thread, exception, rtti' ?
	- to check everything with non-latin1 dir and file names - QFile::encodeName

Sender:
	- to get information about environment (OS, hardware, software versions, etc.)
	- to get information about crashed program (version, ...)
	- send minidump with above-mentioned information and user's comment

google-breakpad:
	- *nix: Does it support debugging symbols which was stripped to other file? (libA.so and libA.so.debug)
	- GNU/Linux: Add support for DWARF symbols.

Build:
	- 'make test'
	- 'make install' - needed?

Demo:
	- GUI for search in minidump (for sensitive data like passwords); highlight words 'password', 'login', etc.

Docs:
	- "What do you expect to have in debug/release build?"
	- debugging symbols
	- special debugging code (#ifndef NDEBUG)
	- linking with debug versions of libraries
